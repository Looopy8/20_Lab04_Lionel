Unit Testing

Unit testing is the execution of a complete class, routine or small program that has
been written by a single programmer or team of programmers, which is tested in
isolation from the more complete system.
Unit testing (or component testing) is to test the smallest units or software
components in a program.

Integration Testing

Integration testing is the combined execution of two or more classes, packages, components, or
subsystems that have been created by multiple programmers or programming teams
